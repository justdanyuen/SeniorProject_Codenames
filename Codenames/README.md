# Codenames AI Competition UI

#### Note: This project is still in development, and it works hand-in-hand with the [Codenames Server](https://github.com/N8WM/Codenames-Server) repository.

This is the UI for the Codenames AI Competition Framework.

## Running the UI for the first time

First clone the repository and run `npm i`. Then, `npm run dev` can be called. You can then find the page at [http://localhost:3000/arena/](http://localhost:3000/arena/). To run a game of Codenames with the UI, an instance of `codenames/index.py` from the [Codenames Server](https://github.com/N8WM/Codenames-Server) needs to be running.
